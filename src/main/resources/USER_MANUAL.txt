Memorizer — User Manual

Overview
- Memorizer is a distraction-minimized SRS helper with a taskbar-like Stealth banner (Normal/Mini) and a standard Main window.
- Data is stored in an embedded H2 database; decks, notes, and cards are managed locally.

Stealth Banner (Normal/Mini)
- Show/Hide: Tray menu → Show Stealth Now; shortcut F8 toggles while focused.
- Modes: Press M to toggle Normal/Mini. Mini is a single-row compact view.
- Theme: Press T to toggle Dark/Light.
- Flip cycle (per card): Front → Back → Front+Back+Reading/Pos+Examples → Front (repeat).
- Rating: 1 Again, 2 Hard, 3 Good, 4 Easy. Flip button is neutral.
- Progress: Overlay shows Today x/target; bar caps at 100%. Text capped to target (e.g., 50/50).
- Examples: Multi-line in Normal; single-line in Mini (marquee when long).

Main Window
- Tabs: Dashboard, Plan, Exam. Dashboard shows global stats; Plan shows today’s plan; Exam provides a quick drill tool.
- Data menu:
  - New Deck…: create a new deck by name.
  - New Entry…: manually add a note (Front/Back/Reading/Pos/Examples/Tags) to a deck. A card is created automatically.
- View → Deck: filter plan and Stealth by deck (All Decks or a specific deck id). The filter persists and is shared across Desktop and PWA via the DB/Config.

Study Flow
- Tick-based reminders are serialized: no new Stealth window appears during an active session; ticks defer automatically.
- ESC or Snooze defers the current card by a short interval.

Shortcuts (Stealth)
- SPACE/ENTER: Flip
- 1/2/3/4: Again/Hard/Good/Easy
- ESC: Hide (optionally snooze)
- M: Toggle Mini/Normal
- T: Toggle Dark/Light
- F8: Toggle Stealth show/hide (when window focused)

Configuration
- application.properties documents all available settings (UI, scheduling, DB, plan limits, theme, deck filter).
- app.deck.filter controls the global deck filter ("all" or deck id).
- app.ui.theme controls Dark/Light at startup; can be toggled at runtime.

Troubleshooting
- If the Stealth banner shows near the taskbar with a gap, ensure overlay-taskbar=false and DPI settings are typical (100–150%).
- If Maven can’t resolve plugins, adjust settings.xml to use Maven Central (avoid localhost proxies).
